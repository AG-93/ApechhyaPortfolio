<h2> Description </h2>
My motivation was to create a portoflio page using flex box. I've learnt what flex box does on a webpage and how it structures the layout of the webpage. 

I faced some challenges half way through and was unable to add pictures onto the flexbox for each content however after a tutuorial lesson, I've learnt that I can create multiple script / sheet of code for each html. I also create a separate div for each section of the content page.
